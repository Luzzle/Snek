Snek was a challenge I set for myself randomly when I was bored in study while I should have been getting ready for HSC. I set myself 48 hours to develop the entire game of Snake,
from scratch using Raylib for the OpenGL bindings and with no other dependencies. The challenge was that I would program the game using 0 prior research into how the game works,
the collision detection, or anything else. It was a challenge of pure creativity and I am proud to say I pulled through in only 4 hours of work.
